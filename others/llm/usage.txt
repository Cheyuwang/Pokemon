Error in `tibble()`:
! Tibble columns must have compatible sizes.
• Size 6: Existing data.
• Size 19: Column `AwayTeam`.
ℹ Only values of size one are recycled.
Backtrace:
 1. tibble::tibble(...)

ChatGPT: 
The error you're encountering arises because the tibble() function in R requires that all columns have the same length unless one of the columns has a length of one, in which case it can be recycled to match the lengths of the other columns. In your case, you have HY with 6 values and AwayTeam with 19 values, which is incompatible for creating a single tibble.
If your intent is to combine these two sets of data, you need to ensure they have matching lengths or that one column is intended to be recycled. Given the data you've provided, it seems like you may want to show a list of AwayTeam without a corresponding HY for each team or perhaps intend to assign HY values in a different manner.
Fixing the Issue
Here are a few ways to correct this, depending on your intended outcome:
Option 1: Equal Length Columns
If every AwayTeam should have a corresponding HY, you need to ensure each team has an HY value. For demonstration, I'll repeat the HY values as needed.
football <- tibble(
  HY = rep(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), length.out = 19),  # Repeat or extend HY values to match AwayTeam
  AwayTeam = c(
    "Arsenal", "Aston Villa", "Brentford", "Brighton", "Chelsea", 
    "Crystal Palace", "Everton", "Fulham", "Leeds United", "Leicester City", 
    "Liverpool", "Manchester City", "Manchester United", "Newcastle United", 
    "Nottingham Forest", "Southampton", "Tottenham Hotspur", "West Ham United", 
    "Wolverhampton Wanderers"
